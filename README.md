# MQTT-Tios

MQTT-Tios is a version of [Tios](https://bitbucket.org/claughton/tios/wiki/Overview) that communicates using the indusstry-standard
[MQTT protocol](https://mqtt.org) for IoT devices.

This is a complete rewrite of the original Tios code, with currently a very different user interface. The focus is on simulations using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org).
